## 🧠 What is a Microfrontend?

A **microfrontend** is an architectural approach that breaks a web application into smaller, independent apps. Each microfrontend can be developed, deployed, and maintained separately—potentially by different teams—and later integrated into a host application using techniques such as **Module Federation** (via Webpack or Vite).
